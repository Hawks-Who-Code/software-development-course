# Introduction

Where do we code?

- CodeHS
- Code.org
- Scratch

Professional developers don’t really use these to write code. Students learn to code on these platforms because they abstract away some of the stuff it takes to get code to start doing things. In this lesson, we will try to un-abstract away the process by installing an IDE and trying it out.

What is a text editor/IDE?

- Text editors are places we can write code
- IDEs are basically text editors with a lot of other features, often compilers and debuggers, to support making full-fledged apps

Common text editors and IDEs

- VS Code
- Notepad++
- Vim
- Visual Studio
- Eclipse
- Intellij IDEA

We will mostly be using VS Code because it is the most common text editor, it supports almost every language, and is overall just nice

# Installation

The process really is just looking up the files to install and following the instructions.

- Install VS Code at https://code.visualstudio.com/
- Python can be installed at https://www.python.org/. The Microsoft Store can also install Python for Windows
- Nodejs and NPM can be installed at https://nodejs.org/en but it requires admin--you should not install on the school computers
- Java is a bit weirder since there are a lot of different ways to go about it. The simplest way is going to the Java downloads page from Oracle here https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/

# Trying out VS Code

Opening files

- Can open stuff and create new files within the editor
- Recommend “open with code” option on folders from file explorer

The interface

- Code main code area
- You can make more panels and adjust things
- Sidebar to look at file structure and other features
- Terminal at the bottom to run the code and commands

Plugins
- Can open from the sidebar
- We highly recommend installing a theme you find appealing with nice icons
- Install the relevant plugin for the language you are writing to get some “smarter” features like catching syntax errors
- Other useful plugins like Live Server, Live Share, spellcheck, stuff to format the code, etc.

The command palette
- CTRL+SHIFT+P
- Lots of stuff you might want to do can be done through the command palette
- Often faster than clicking through to find certain options

# What to do next

Homework: try installing VS Code on your home computer and the compilers/interpreters for the languages you want. Install themes to make it look nice.
