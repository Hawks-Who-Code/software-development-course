# Suggested Material and Prerequisite Knowledge

- Basic coding knowledge
- A personal laptop or other computer (A chromebook is fine but not recommended)
- Something to take notes on

# Welcome

This course is not meant to teach people how to code. Rather, this course caters to people who have learned the fundamentals of coding but have not yet applied it to real applications. This is meant to bridge the gap between coding basics and real world software development involving several moving parts and working with people to make deliverables.
Structure
This course has two main phases. The first is teaching the fundamentals for any software project as well as maintaining quality code. The course will then dive into the web development and video game design specializations.

Almost the entire class will consist purely of lecturing and note taking rather than actual practice. Those who take this course are expected to be working on their own projects and code on their own time.

Every week, a new problem set will be assigned to be submitted online Monday night to allow the teachers to review the code for the Wednesday lesson. Submissions from the previous week will be reviewed for possible improvements.

Doing the problem sets are not required but highly recommended to help improve coding skills. They are not meant to be a large time investment. If it is taking a long time, ASK US FOR HELP.
